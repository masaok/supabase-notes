## Show Timestamps in Local Time

To set your Supabase (PostgreSQL) database to display timestamps in the local time zone rather than UTC, you can adjust the timezone at the session or database level. By default, timestamps are usually stored in UTC, but you can configure the timezone for display purposes.

### Option 1: Set Time Zone for the Session

If you only want to set the timezone for the current session, you can use the following SQL command:

```sql
SET TIME ZONE 'Your/Timezone';
```

Replace `Your/Timezone` with your desired timezone, such as `'America/Los_Angeles'` or `'Europe/London'`. For example:

```sql
SET TIME ZONE 'America/New_York';
```

This will only apply to the current session and will not affect other connections.

### Option 2: Set Time Zone for All Connections (Permanent Change)

If you want the change to be applied by default for all connections to the database, you need to modify the `timezone` setting in the PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`). However, in Supabase, direct access to the configuration file may not be possible, so you can set it at the database level using:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE your_database_name SET timezone TO 'Your/Timezone';
```

Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your database and `Your/Timezone` with the appropriate timezone. For example:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE my_database SET timezone TO 'America/New_York';
```

This setting will persist and apply to all future sessions connecting to the database.

### Important Note

This only affects the display format of timestamps. Timestamps will still be stored in UTC in the database for consistency and reliability. If you retrieve timestamps, they will be displayed in the specified timezone.
